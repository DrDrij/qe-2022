In September 2022, we hosted workshops on scientific and high performance computing at the Central Bank of Chile. The workshops were led by John Stachurski (QuantEcon) and [Pablo Winant](https://www.mosphere.fr) (ESCP Business School) in Python and Julia. Materials from the workshop can be found on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/QuantEcon/cbc_workshops).
