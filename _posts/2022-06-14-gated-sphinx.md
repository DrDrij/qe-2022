title: "Updates to Exercises in Python Lectures"
author: Natasha Watkins
excerpt: Styled Exercises and Solutions using sphinx-exercise v0.4 
---

Using new functionality from [sphinx-exercise](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-exercise), QuantEcon [Python](https://python.quantecon.org/intro.html) and [Python programming](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) lectures now include styled exercises and hide's exercise solutions by default. [sphinx-exercise v0.4](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-exercise/releases/tag/v0.4.0) introduces gated directives, allowing code in exercises and solutions to be nested within the lecture while still being executable. The sphinx-exercise documentation has been updated with more information about [the gated syntax](https://ebp-sphinx-exercise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax.html#alternative-gated-syntax).
