title: "Updates to Exercises in Python Lectures"
author: Natasha Watkins
excerpt: Sphinx v0.4 allows QuantEcon Python lectures to hide exercise solutions by default.  
---

Using new functionality from Sphinx, QuantEcon [Python](https://python.quantecon.org/intro.html) and [Python programming](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) lectures now hide exercise solutions by default. [Sphinx v0.4](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-exercise/releases/tag/v0.4.0) introduces gated directives with executable code, allowing code in exercises and solutions to be nested within the lecture while still being executable. The Sphinx documentation has been updated with more information about [gated syntax](https://ebp-sphinx-exercise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/syntax.html#alternative-gated-syntax).
