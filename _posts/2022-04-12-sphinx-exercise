The latest release of the [Sphinx exercise extension](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-exercise) enables executable code in exercises and solutions. Exercises in QuantEcon's [Python programming](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/intro.html) lectures have been updated with this new feature, with [Python](https://python.quantecon.org/intro.html) and [Advanced Python](https://python-advanced.quantecon.org/intro.html) lectures to follow. To read about how to incorporate executable code with Sphinx exercise/solution directives, see the [release notes for sphinx-exercise v0.4](https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-exercise/releases/tag/v0.4.0).
