A [new Python lecture](https://python.quantecon.org/two_auctions.html) on first- and second-price sealed-bid auctions of a single good has been added. The lecture sets up and solves for an agent's optimal bid given their valuation, and proves with a numerical example that the Revenue Equivalence Theorem holds â€” that is, the expected revenue of both types of auctions are equal. In the case where closed form solutions cannot be found, the lecture provides a method to simulate an agent's optimal bidding strategy. A subsequent lecture on [multiple good auctions](https://python.quantecon.org/house_auction.html) relaxes the single-good assumption and considers an simultaneous, multiple-good, ascending-price auction.
