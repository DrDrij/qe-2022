 A new lecture titled ["Two Meanings of Probability"](https://python.quantecon.org/prob_meaning.html) compares Bayesian and Frequentist approaches to estimating parameters of a distribution. Using Python to simulate random draws from a binomial distribution, estimating the parameters using the Frequentist approach is shown to converge to the true parameters by the Law of Large Numbers. Similarly, as a Bayesian observes more random draws from the binomial distribution, they become more confident about the true value of the parameters.
