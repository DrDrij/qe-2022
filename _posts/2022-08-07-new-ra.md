We would like to give a warm welcome to Maanasee Sharma, who has joined QuantEcon as a research assistant. Maanasee is a Masters student at the Delhi School of Economics and has a Bachelors in Mathematics from the Lady Shri Ram College for Women. She will be assisting with new QuantEcon lectures and textbook material, as well as acting as a Teaching Assistant for QuantEcon's [online intensive course](https://quantecon.github.io/indian_summer_workshop/) this August. We look forward to having Maanasee part of our team!
