# Julia Lectures Updated to 1.3

The QuantEcon Julia lectures have been updated to use Julia 1.3. Additionally, the new Julia version has been installed on associated cloud servers, such as `quantecon.syzygy.ca.` The release comes with performance improvements and bug fixes that we are happy to add to the lectures.
