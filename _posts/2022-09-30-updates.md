We have updated our [NumPy lecture](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/numpy.html#broadcasting) to include a discussion of how broadcasting in NumPy makes code faster and less memory-intensive. We have also added a section on variable names to the [Advancing Programming in Python lecture](https://python-programming.quantecon.org/oop_intro.html#names-and-name-resolution). This section looks at local, builtin, and global namespaces in Python, how to view namespaces and name resolution rules. Many thanks to our research assistant Humphrey Yang for his improvements to the lectures.
