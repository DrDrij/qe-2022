[Quantitative Economics with Julia](https://julia.quantecon.org/intro.html) has been updated to support the latest version of Julia (v1.7). This update follows significant changes to the [Julia side of the lectures](https://quantecon.org/2021/09/08/julia-lectures-update.html) in September 2021. Many thanks to Jesse Perla, his team, and support from the [Center for Innovative Data in Economic Research (CIDER)](https://economics.ubc.ca/cider/research-activity/#:~:text=The%20Centre%20for%20Innovative%20Data,on%20economics%20and%20related%20fields.) at the [Vancouver School of Economics at the University of British Columbia](https://economics.ubc.ca/).
