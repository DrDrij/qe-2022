# Forthcoming Textbook

A hardcopy text on Quantitative Economics is now in the works, hopefully to be
completed before the end of 2020.  The textbook is coauthored Thomas Sargent
and John Stachurski and focuses on theory and algorithms rather than
implementation details.  The plan is for the book to be language agnostic, in
the sense that algorithms are described in pseudo-code rather than any
particular language.

The theory of dynamic programming is treated in depth.  Some continuous time
stochastic dynamics will also be included.

A preliminary version will be posted on this page in the next few weeks.
Feedback and suggestions are appreciated.  They can be directed to
contact@quantecon.org.
