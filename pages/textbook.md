# Forthcoming Textbooks

QuantEcon members are preparing a series of high quality hardcopy textbooks on topics in computational economics and economic dynamics, partly supported by generous funding from [Schmidt Futures](https://schmidtfutures.com/).

The textbooks will combine a free PDF with published hardcopy.

The first text, on network economics, is available [here](https://networks.quantecon.org/).

Forthcoming hardcopy textbooks include

* Dynamic Programming Volume I:  Foundations
* Dynamic Programming Volume II: Advanced Theory
* Macroeconomic Dynamics: Theory and Computation
* Machine Learning and Econometrics

Suggestions on topics are welcome.  Please direct them to
[contact@quantecon.org](mailto:contact@quantecon.org) or the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.quantecon.org/).
