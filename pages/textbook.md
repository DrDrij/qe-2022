# Forthcoming Textbook

A hardcopy textbook on Quantitative Economics is currently under preparation.
Our aim is to complete it before the end of 2020.  The textbook is coauthored
by Thomas Sargent and John Stachurski.  Financial support from [Schmidt
Futures](https://schmidtfutures.com/) is gratefully acknowledged.

The main features are

* a focus on theory and algorithms rather than implementation details,
* a language-agnostic presentation (algorithms are described in pseudo-code),
* a modern, general, in-depth treatment of dynamic programming with economic
  applications,
* a modern treatment of Markov process theory, and
* coverage of both continuous and discrete time systems.

A very preliminary table of contents is available [here](../assets/downloads/toc_may_2020.pdf).

A preliminary draft of the book is available [here](../assets/downloads/main.pdf).

Feedback and suggestions are all greatly appreciated.  Please direct them to
contact@quantecon.org or the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.quantecon.org/).
